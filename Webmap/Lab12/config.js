    subtitle: 'Assessing Risks to Vulnerable Housing',

    para1: 'Coastal flooding is a serious threat to New York City, and its impacts are expected to worsen with climate change. Sea levels are rising, and coastal storms are becoming more frequent and intense. As a result, coastal flooding can cause damage to property and infrastructure, disrupt transportation and communication, and pose a risk to human health and safety.',
    para2: 'Assessing risks to vulnerable housing is an important step in developing and implementing effective policies and programs to protect these communities. Vulnerable housing can be defined as housing that is at risk of damage or destruction from natural hazards, such as floods, earthquakes, or wildfires, or from human-caused hazards, such as pollution or neglect.',
